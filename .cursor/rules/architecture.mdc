## Architecture

- This is a Django project built on Python 3.12.
- User authentication uses `django-allauth`.
- The front end is mostly standard Django views and templates.
- HTMX and Alpine.js are used to provide single-page-app user experience with Django templates.
  HTMX is used for interactions which require accessing the backend, and Alpine.js is used for
  browser-only interactions.
- JavaScript files are kept in the `/assets/` folder and built by vite.
  JavaScript code is typically loaded via the static files framework inside Django templates using `django-vite`.
- APIs use Django Rest Framework, and JavaScript code that interacts with APIs uses an
  auto-generated OpenAPI-schema-baesd client.
- The front end uses Tailwind (Version 4) and DaisyUI.
- The main database is Postgres.
- Celery is used for background jobs and scheduled tasks.
- Redis is used as the default cache, and the message broker for Celery (if enabled).
