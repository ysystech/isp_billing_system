## JavaScript Code Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use ES6+ syntax for JavaScript code.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation in JavaScript, JSX, and HTML files.
- Use single quotes for JavaScript strings.
- End statements with semicolons.
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for component names (React).
- Use explicit type annotations in TypeScript files.
- Use ES6 import/export syntax for module management.

### Preferred Practices
- When using HTMX, follow progressive enhancement patterns.
- Use Alpine.js for client-side interactivity that doesn't require server interaction.
- Use the generated OpenAPI client for API calls instead of raw fetch or axios calls.
- Validate user input on both client and server side.
- Handle errors explicitly in promise chains and async functions.

### Build System

- Code is bundled using vite and served with `django-vite`.
