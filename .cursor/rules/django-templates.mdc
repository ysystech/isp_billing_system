## Django Template Coding Guidelines for HTML files

- Indent templates with two spaces.
- Use standard Django template syntax.
- JavaScript and CSS files built with vite should be included with the `{% vite_asset %}` template tag provided by `django-vite` (must have `{% load django_vite %}` at the top of the template)
- Any react components also need `{% vite_react_refresh %}` for Vite + React's HMR functionality, from the same `django_vite` template library)
- Use the Django `{% static %}` tag for loading images and external JavaScript / CSS files not managed by vite.
- Break re-usable template components into separate templates with `{% include %}` statements.
  These normally go into a `components` folder.
- Use DaisyUI styling markup for available components. When not available, fall back to standard TailwindCSS classes.
- Stick with the DaisyUI color palette whenever possible.
