## General Coding Preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions.
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality.
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested.
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we donâ€™t have duplicate logic.
- Keep the codebase clean and organized.
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once.
- Try to avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
- Don't ever add mock data to functions. Only add mocks to tests or utilities that are only used by tests.
- Always think about what other areas of code might be affected by any changes made.
- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming.
