# Customer URL Fix

## Date: June 30, 2025

## Issue
- `NoReverseMatch` error when creating or updating customers
- Error: "Reverse for 'detail' not found"

## Root Cause
The customer views were using incorrect URL names:
- Using `"customers:detail"` instead of `"customers:customer_detail"`
- Using `"customers:list"` instead of `"customers:customer_list"`

## Solution
Fixed the URL references in `apps/customers/views.py`:

1. **customer_create view** (line 89):
   - Changed: `redirect("customers:detail", pk=customer.pk)`
   - To: `redirect("customers:customer_detail", pk=customer.pk)`

2. **customer_update view** (line 112):
   - Changed: `redirect("customers:detail", pk=customer.pk)`
   - To: `redirect("customers:customer_detail", pk=customer.pk)`

3. **customer_delete view** (line 135):
   - Changed: `redirect("customers:list")`
   - To: `redirect("customers:customer_list")`

## URL Pattern Reference
The correct URL names defined in `apps/customers/urls.py`:
- `customer_list` - List all customers
- `customer_create` - Create new customer
- `customer_detail` - View customer details
- `customer_update` - Edit customer
- `customer_delete` - Delete customer

## Testing
Created and ran tests to verify the fixes work correctly. Customer creation now properly redirects to the detail page.

## Impact
- Customer creation works correctly
- Customer updates work correctly
- Customer deletion works correctly
- All redirects now use the proper URL names
