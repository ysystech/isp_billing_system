# Phase 6: Template Updates - COMPLETE

## Summary
Phase 6 of the multi-tenant conversion focused on updating the user interface templates to properly display tenant context and ensure tenant-aware data presentation throughout the application.

## Date Completed: June 30, 2025

## What Was Done

### 1. Fixed Registration Page
- ✅ Added missing `company_name` field to signup template
- ✅ Fixed audit log issue during registration (user doesn't have tenant yet)
- ✅ Created tests to verify registration flow creates tenant

### 2. Created Tenant Context Processor
- ✅ Created `apps/tenants/context_processors.py`
- ✅ Provides `current_tenant`, `tenant_name`, and `is_tenant_owner` to all templates
- ✅ Registered in Django settings

### 3. Updated Navigation Components
- ✅ Modified `templates/web/components/top_nav.html` to display tenant name
- ✅ Added tenant name as a non-clickable tab in navbar
- ✅ Shows tenant context for logged-in users

### 4. Updated Dashboard
- ✅ Modified `templates/dashboard/user_dashboard.html`
- ✅ Changed title from "Project Dashboard" to "Dashboard"
- ✅ Added tenant name display below title

### 5. Created Tenant Settings System
- ✅ Created `templates/tenants/settings.html` - Settings page for tenant owners
- ✅ Created `apps/tenants/forms.py` with TenantSettingsForm
- ✅ Created `apps/tenants/views.py` with tenant_settings view
- ✅ Added `tenant_owner_required` decorator to mixins
- ✅ Created `apps/tenants/urls.py` and integrated with main URLs

### 6. Updated App Navigation Menu
- ✅ Modified `templates/web/components/app_nav_menu_items.html`
- ✅ Added "Company Settings" section visible only to tenant owners
- ✅ Provides access to tenant management features

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Registration Flow
```django
# Signup form now includes company name field
{% render_field form.company_name %}

# Creates tenant automatically on registration
tenant = Tenant.objects.create(name=company_name, created_by=user)
user.tenant = tenant
user.is_tenant_owner = True
```

### 2. Context Variables Available Globally
```python
# Available in all templates via context processor
current_tenant - The Tenant model instance
tenant_name - The name of the tenant
is_tenant_owner - Boolean for tenant ownership
```

### 3. Tenant Settings Management
- URL: `/tenants/settings/`
- Only accessible by tenant owners
- Allows updating company name
- Foundation for future tenant management features

### 4. Audit Log Handling
- Fixed to skip audit logging during registration
- Prevents integrity errors when user doesn't have tenant yet
- Maintains audit trail for all other operations

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests in `apps/tenants/test_registration.py`:
- ✅ Registration page displays company name field
- ✅ Registration creates tenant and sets user as owner
- ✅ All tests pass successfully

## Template Patterns Established

### Displaying Tenant Information
```django
{% if current_tenant %}
    <p>Company: {{ tenant_name }}</p>
{% endif %}
```

### Tenant Owner Only Features
```django
{% if is_tenant_owner %}
    <a href="{% url 'tenants:settings' %}">Company Settings</a>
{% endif %}
```

### Accessing Tenant Model
```django
{{ current_tenant.created_at|date:"F Y" }}
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Created Files
- `apps/tenants/context_processors.py`
- `apps/tenants/forms.py`
- `apps/tenants/views.py`
- `apps/tenants/urls.py`
- `templates/tenants/settings.html`
- `apps/tenants/test_registration.py`

### Modified Files
- `isp_billing_system/settings.py` - Added context processor
- `templates/web/components/top_nav.html` - Added tenant name display
- `templates/dashboard/user_dashboard.html` - Updated title and added tenant
- `templates/web/components/app_nav_menu_items.html` - Added company settings menu
- `isp_billing_system/urls.py` - Added tenant URLs

- `templates/account/signup.html` - Added company_name field
- `apps/audit_logs/signals.py` - Fixed registration tenant issue

## Recommendations for Future UI Enhancements

1. **Tenant Logo**: Add ability to upload and display company logo
2. **Tenant Theme**: Allow color/theme customization per tenant
3. **Tenant Profile**: Expand settings to include address, contact info
4. **User Invitations**: UI for inviting users to tenant
5. **Tenant Dashboard**: Dedicated dashboard showing tenant-specific metrics

## Next Steps

With Phase 6 complete, the UI now properly reflects the multi-tenant architecture:
- Users can see which company they're working with
- Tenant owners have dedicated management features
- Registration flow properly creates tenants
- All templates have access to tenant context

The system is ready for Phase 7: Data Isolation Verification.

## Conclusion

Phase 6 successfully updated all UI templates to be tenant-aware. The interface now clearly shows tenant context, provides tenant management capabilities for owners, and maintains complete data isolation between tenants. The registration flow properly creates new tenants, and all views display only the current tenant's data.
