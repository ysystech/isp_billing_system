class MyModelTest(TenantTestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        super().setUp()  # Creates tenant and users
        # additional setup code
```

### Form Testing Pattern
```python
# Pass tenant to forms that need it
form = CustomerForm(data={...}, tenant=self.tenant)
```

### View Testing Pattern
```python
# Login with tenant user
self.client.login(username='testuser', password='testpass123')
response = self.client.get('/customers/')
# Should only see data from self.tenant
```

## Status Summary

### What Works:
- ✅ Test base classes properly set up tenants
- ✅ Most test files updated with tenant awareness
- ✅ Test patterns established for future tests

### What Needs Fixing:
- ❌ Syntax errors in views preventing test execution
- ❌ Some complex queries may need manual tenant filtering
- ❌ Integration tests need comprehensive updates

### Recommendation:
1. First priority: Fix syntax errors from Phase 3 automated updates
2. Run tests incrementally, fixing issues as they arise
3. Add comprehensive tenant isolation tests
4. Document any special cases or exceptions

## Phase 4 Progress: ~70% Complete

The test infrastructure is in place, but execution is blocked by syntax errors from the automated view updates. Once these are resolved, the tests should be able to run and any remaining issues can be addressed.
