# ISP Billing System - Project Knowledge Base (Updated - June 30, 2025)
=================================================================================

## Project Overview
A comprehensive billing management system originally built for a small-scale Internet Service Provider (ISP) in Cagayan de Oro, Northern Mindanao, Philippines. **NOW BEING CONVERTED TO MULTI-TENANT SAAS** to support multiple ISP companies in a single deployment.

### Multi-Tenant Architecture Status
- **Conversion Started**: June 29, 2025
- **Current Status**: Phase 9 of 10 COMPLETE (90% overall)
- **Architecture**: Shared database with row-level tenant isolation
- **Target**: Complete isolation between ISP companies
- **Recent Achievement**: Reporting system now fully tenant-aware

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Django 5.2.2 with Python 3.12
- **Frontend**: Django Templates + HTMX + Alpine.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + DaisyUI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache/Queue**: Redis
- **Task Queue**: Celery
- **Development**: Docker Compose
- **Base Framework**: Pegasus SaaS
- **Maps**: Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap
- **PDF Generation**: WeasyPrint
- **Time Zone**: Asia/Manila (Philippine Standard Time)

## Multi-Tenant Conversion Progress

### âœ… Phase 1-9 Complete (90%)
All major systems are now tenant-aware:
1. **Core Infrastructure** - Tenant model, middleware, authentication
2. **Database Models** - All models inherit from TenantAwareModel
3. **View Layer** - All views filter by tenant with @tenant_required
4. **Test Suite** - Comprehensive tenant-aware testing framework
5. **API Layer** - All APIs respect tenant boundaries
6. **UI/Templates** - Tenant context displayed throughout
7. **Security** - Complete isolation verified with tools
8. **Background Tasks** - Celery tasks maintain tenant context
9. **Reporting** - All reports and analytics are tenant-scoped

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 10: Final Testing & Migration (REMAINING)
- Comprehensive end-to-end testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Migration strategy for existing data
- Production deployment planning

## Key Multi-Tenant Features

### Data Isolation
- Complete row-level isolation between tenants
- No shared data or cross-tenant access
- Tenant field indexed on all models
- CASCADE delete for data cleanup

### Security Model
- Tenant owners bypass all permissions within their tenant
- Regular users follow RBAC permissions
- No super admin cross-tenant access
- Audit logging tracks all changes

### Background Processing
- Celery tasks maintain tenant context
- Scheduled tasks process each tenant separately
- System users handle background operations
- Comprehensive audit trail

### Reporting System
- All reports filter by request.tenant
- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG) respect boundaries
- CSV/Excel exports contain only tenant data
- Dashboard statistics properly scoped

## Summary

The ISP Billing System is 90% complete in its multi-tenant conversion. Only final testing and deployment planning remain. The system provides complete isolation between ISP companies while maintaining all original functionality.
