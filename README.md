# ISP Billing System

Billing System

## Installation - Docker

The easiest way to get up and running is with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Just [install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
and then run:

```
make init
```

This will spin up a database, web worker, celery worker, and Redis broker and run your migrations.

You can then go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) to view the app.

*Note: if you get an error, make sure you have a `.env` file, or create one based on `.env.example`.*

### Using the Makefile

You can run `make` to see other helper functions, and you can view the source
of the file in case you need to run any specific commands.

For example, you can run management commands in containers using the same method
used in the `Makefile`. E.g.

```
docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Installation - Native

You can also install/run the app directly on your OS using the instructions below.
Setup a virtualenv and install requirements
(this example uses [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)):

```bash
mkvirtualenv isp_billing_system -p python3.12
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

## Set up database

*If you are using Docker you can skip these steps.*

Create a database named `isp_billing_system`.

```
createdb isp_billing_system
```

Create database migrations:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
```

Create database tables:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

## Running server

**Docker:**

```bash
make start
```

**Native:**

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Building front-end

To build JavaScript and CSS files, first install npm packages:

**Docker:**

```bash
make npm-install
```

**Native:**

```bash
npm install
```

Then build (and watch for changes locally):

**Docker:**

```bash
make npm-watch
```

**Native:**

```bash
npm run dev-watch
```

## Running Celery

Celery can be used to run background tasks.
If you use Docker it will start automatically.

You can run it using:

```bash
celery -A isp_billing_system worker -l INFO --pool=solo
```

Or with celery beat (for scheduled tasks):

```bash
celery -A isp_billing_system worker -l INFO -B --pool=solo
```

Note: Using the `solo` pool is recommended for development but not for production.

## Installing Git commit hooks

To install the Git commit hooks run the following:

```shell
$ pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

Once these are installed they will be run on every commit.

For more information see the [docs](https://docs.saaspegasus.com/code-structure.html#code-formatting).

## Running Tests

To run tests:

**Docker:**

```bash
make test
```

**Native:**

```bash
python manage.py test
```

Or to test a specific app/module:

**Docker:**

```bash
make test ARGS='apps.utils.tests.test_slugs --keepdb'
```

**Native:**

```bash
python manage.py test apps.utils.tests.test_slugs
```

On Linux-based systems you can watch for changes using the following:

**Docker:**

```bash
find . -name '*.py' | entr docker compose exec web python manage.py test apps.utils.tests.test_slugs
```

**Native:**

```bash
find . -name '*.py' | entr python manage.py test apps.utils.tests.test_slugs
```
