# Router Form Update - From Modal to Full Page

## Date: June 30, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Router List Page
**File**: `apps/routers/templates/routers/router_list.html`
- Removed HTMX attributes from "Add New Router" button
- Removed modal container div
- Now uses standard page navigation like Customer module

### 2. Updated Router Create Template
**File**: `apps/routers/templates/routers/router_create.html`
- Redesigned to match Customer form style
- Added card-based sections:
  - Router Information (Brand, Model)
  - Technical Details (Serial Number, MAC Address)
  - Additional Information (Notes)
- Uses `{% render_field %}` for consistent field rendering
- Professional layout with proper spacing

### 3. Updated Router Update Template
**File**: `apps/routers/templates/routers/router_update.html`
- Matching design with create form
- Same card-based sections
- Consistent styling across all forms

### 4. Updated Router List Partial
**File**: `apps/routers/templates/routers/partials/router_list.html`
- Removed HTMX attributes from inline edit buttons
- Now uses standard links for editing

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Router forms now match the style of Customer forms
2. **Better UX**: Full page forms provide more space and better organization
3. **Accessibility**: Standard page navigation is more accessible
4. **Maintainability**: Simpler code without modal complexity

2. Navigate to `/routers/{id}/update/` (full page)

## Testing

All tests pass successfully.
