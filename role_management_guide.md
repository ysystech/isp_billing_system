# Role-Based Permission Management Guide (Continued)

## Common Issues (Continued)

1. **Missing UI Elements**
   - If you can't see a role or action, you likely don't have the required permissions
   - Superusers can confirm if the element exists but is hidden due to permissions

2. **Can't Assign Certain Roles**
   - You can only assign roles containing permissions you have
   - This is by design to prevent permission escalation

3. **Permission Errors**
   - Error messages will clearly state when you're attempting to access or assign unauthorized roles
   - These errors indicate the security system is working correctly

4. **Changes Not Taking Effect**
   - Role changes are immediate, but may require page refresh
   - Verify role assignments in the user detail view

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't see a role in the list
- **Check**: Do you have all the permissions contained in that role?
- **Solution**: Ask a superuser or user with higher permissions to manage that role

### Issue: Can't assign a role to a user
- **Check**: Does the role contain permissions you don't have?
- **Solution**: Either gain the missing permissions yourself, or ask someone with appropriate permissions to assign the role

### Issue: Can't edit role permissions
- **Check**: Are you trying to add permissions you don't have?
- **Solution**: Only add permissions you have, or ask a superuser to make the changes

### Issue: System role doesn't appear
- **Check**: System roles can only be managed by superusers
- **Solution**: Contact a superuser to manage system roles

## Role Design Guidelines

1. **Create Clear Permission Hierarchies**
   - Organize roles in a clear hierarchy (e.g., Admin > Manager > Staff)
   - Each level should have specific responsibilities

2. **Use Descriptive Names**
   - Name roles based on job functions or responsibilities
   - Add clear descriptions explaining the role's purpose

3. **Separate Read/Write Permissions**
   - Consider creating "View Only" roles for reporting users
   - Create separate roles for users who need to make changes

4. **Group Permissions Logically**
   - Group related permissions together in roles
   - Avoid mixing unrelated permissions in the same role

5. **Start with Minimal Permissions**
   - Begin with the minimum necessary permissions
   - Add more as needed rather than starting with too many

## Security Considerations

1. **Regular Permission Audits**
   - Regularly review who has which roles and permissions
   - Remove permissions when they're no longer needed

2. **Document Role Purposes**
   - Document what each role is for and who should have it
   - Keep this documentation updated as roles change

3. **Test After Changes**
   - After changing roles, test to ensure proper functionality
   - Verify that users can only access what they should

4. **Use the Audit Log**
   - Review the audit log to track permission changes
   - Investigate unexpected permission changes

## Example Role Structure

Here's an example role structure you might consider:

1. **System Administrator**
   - All permissions including user and role management
   - Reserved for technical administrators

2. **Business Manager**
   - All business operations permissions
   - Limited user management, no role management
   - Can view all reports and financial data

3. **Customer Service Representative**
   - View customer information
   - Create and manage support tickets
   - Cannot modify subscriptions or billing information

4. **Field Technician**
   - Manage installations and infrastructure
   - Update ticket status
   - Limited customer information access

5. **Billing Specialist**

   - Generate receipts and reports
   - View customer information

6. **Reports Viewer**
   - View-only access to reports and analytics
   - No ability to modify any data
