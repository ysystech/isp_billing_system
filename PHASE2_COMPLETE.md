# Multi-Tenant Phase 2: Model Updates - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Phase 2 of the multi-tenant conversion is now complete. All business models have been updated to inherit from TenantAwareModel and migrations have been successfully applied.

## Completed Components

### 1. Models Updated to TenantAwareModel
All the following models now inherit from TenantAwareModel and have a `tenant` field:

#### Previously Updated (from Phase 1 planning):
- ✅ Customer
- ✅ Barangay  
- ✅ Router
- ✅ SubscriptionPlan
- ✅ LCP
- ✅ Splitter
- ✅ NAP
- ✅ CustomerInstallation
- ✅ CustomerSubscription
- ✅ Ticket

#### Updated in Phase 2:
- ✅ TicketComment (apps/tickets/models.py)
- ✅ Role (apps/roles/models.py)
- ✅ AuditLogEntry (apps/audit_logs/models.py)

### 2. Model Changes Made

#### TicketComment
- Changed from `BaseModel` to `TenantAwareModel`
- Now automatically includes `tenant` field with CASCADE delete

#### Role
- Changed from `BaseModel` to `TenantAwareModel`
- Removed global unique constraint on `name` field
- Added `unique_together = ['tenant', 'name']` constraint
- Role names can now be duplicated across tenants

#### AuditLogEntry
- Changed from `BaseModel` to `TenantAwareModel`
- Audit logs are now tenant-isolated

### 3. Migrations Created and Applied
- ✅ `tickets/0003_add_tenant_to_ticketcomment.py`
- ✅ `roles/0002_add_tenant_to_role.py`
- ✅ `audit_logs/0003_add_tenant_to_auditlogentry.py`

All migrations use a default tenant (first tenant in the database) for any existing records.

### 4. Models That Don't Need Tenant Awareness
The following models were reviewed and determined NOT to need tenant awareness:
- **PermissionCategory** - Used to organize Django's system-wide permissions
- **PermissionCategoryMapping** - Maps system permissions to categories
- **RolePermissionPreset** - System-wide permission presets

## Technical Notes

### Inheritance Hierarchy
All tenant-aware models now follow this pattern:
```python
BaseModel (timestamps)
    └── TenantAwareModel (adds tenant field)
            └── [Business Model]
```

### Database Constraints
- All tenant-aware models have a ForeignKey to Tenant with CASCADE delete
- Tenant field is indexed for performance
- Unique constraints updated to include tenant where needed

## Next Steps
Phase 3: View Layer Updates
- Add TenantRequiredMixin to all Class-Based Views
- Add @tenant_required decorator to Function-Based Views  
- Update all querysets to filter by tenant
- Ensure forms set tenant on new objects

## Testing
To verify the changes:
```python
# All models should have tenant field
from apps.tickets.models import TicketComment
from apps.roles.models import Role
from apps.audit_logs.models import AuditLogEntry

# Check they all have tenant field
print(hasattr(TicketComment, 'tenant'))  # True
print(hasattr(Role, 'tenant'))  # True
print(hasattr(AuditLogEntry, 'tenant'))  # True
```
