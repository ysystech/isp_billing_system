# User Management Tenant Isolation Fix

## Date: June 30, 2025

## Issue
The User Management module at `/users/management/` was showing all users from different tenants instead of isolating users by tenant.

## Root Cause
The user management views in `views_management.py` were not filtering users by tenant. They were only excluding superusers but showing all other users across all tenants.

## Solution
Updated all user management views to:
1. Add `@tenant_required` decorator
2. Filter users by `tenant=request.tenant`
3. Set tenant when creating new users
4. Ensure all queries respect tenant boundaries

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Views (`apps/users/views_management.py`)

#### User List View
- Added `@tenant_required` decorator
- Changed filter from `CustomUser.objects.filter(is_superuser=False)` 
- To: `CustomUser.objects.filter(tenant=request.tenant, is_superuser=False)`

#### Create User View
- Added `@tenant_required` decorator
- Set `user.tenant = request.tenant` when creating new users
- Ensures new users are assigned to the creator's tenant

#### Update/Delete/Detail Views
- Added `@tenant_required` decorator
- Added `tenant=request.tenant` to all `get_object_or_404` calls
- Prevents accessing users from other tenants (returns 404)

### 2. Role Filtering
The role system was already tenant-aware:
- `get_accessible_roles()` in `apps/roles/helpers/permissions.py` already filters by tenant
- Only shows roles from the user's tenant

## Security Improvements

### Before:
- Any user with view permissions could see ALL users across ALL tenants
- Potential data leak between different companies
- Could attempt to edit/delete users from other tenants

### After:
- Users can only see other users in their own tenant
- Creating users automatically assigns them to the correct tenant
- Attempting to access users from other tenants returns 404
- Complete isolation between tenants

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests in `apps/users/test_tenant_isolation.py`:
- ✅ User list only shows same-tenant users
- ✅ Cannot view user details from other tenant (404)
- ✅ Cannot update users from other tenant (404)
- ✅ New users created with correct tenant
- ✅ Search only returns same-tenant users

All tests pass successfully.

## Impact

This fix ensures complete tenant isolation in user management:
1. **Data Privacy**: Each company only sees their own users
2. **Security**: Cannot access or modify users from other tenants
3. **Compliance**: Proper data isolation for multi-tenant SaaS
4. **User Experience**: Cleaner user list without unrelated users

## Verification

To verify the fix:
1. Login as a user from Tenant A
2. Go to `/users/management/`
3. You should only see users from Tenant A
4. Try to access a user ID from Tenant B directly - should get 404
5. Create a new user - they should be assigned to Tenant A
