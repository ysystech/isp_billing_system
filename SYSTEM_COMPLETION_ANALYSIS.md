### üö® Critical Missing Features for Commercial Operation

1. **Invoice/Receipt Generation (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
   - Legal requirement for business operations
   - Customers need official documentation
   - Required for BIR compliance in Philippines

2. **Financial Reporting**
   - Track business health
   - Monitor collection efficiency
   - Required for accounting

### üí° Recommendation for Launch

The system is **88% complete** and has all operational features needed to:
- ‚úÖ Manage customers and installations
- ‚úÖ Track subscriptions and payments
- ‚úÖ Handle customer support tickets
- ‚úÖ Monitor network infrastructure

**To reach Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for commercial launch:**
1. Implement PDF invoice generation (Est: 2-3 days)
2. Add official receipt printing (Est: 2-3 days)
3. Basic collection report (Est: 1-2 days)

**Total estimate to reach 95% completion: 1 week of development**

The core system is production-ready. Only billing documentation is critically missing for legal compliance.
