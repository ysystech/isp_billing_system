# Multi-Tenant Phase 1: Core Infrastructure - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Phase 1 of the multi-tenant conversion is now complete. All core infrastructure components are in place and tested.

## Completed Components

### 1. Tenant Model (`apps/tenants/models.py`)
- ✅ Created Tenant model with:
  - `name` - Company/organization name (unique)
  - `is_active` - Enable/disable tenants
  - `created_by` - OneToOne link to owner user
  - Inherits from BaseModel (timestamps)

### 2. User Model Updates (`apps/users/models.py`)
- ✅ Added multi-tenant fields:
  - `tenant` - ForeignKey to Tenant (PROTECT on delete)
  - `is_tenant_owner` - Boolean flag for permission bypass
- ✅ Both fields temporarily nullable for migration

### 3. TenantAwareModel (`apps/utils/models.py`)
- ✅ Abstract base model for tenant isolation
- ✅ Adds `tenant` ForeignKey with CASCADE delete
- ✅ Includes database index on tenant field
- ✅ All tenant-isolated models inherit from this

### 4. Tenant Middleware (`apps/tenants/middleware.py`)
- ✅ TenantMiddleware adds `request.tenant` 
- ✅ Lazy loading to avoid unnecessary queries
- ✅ Configured in settings.py MIDDLEWARE

### 5. Authentication Backend (`apps/tenants/backends.py`)
- ✅ TenantAwareBackend replaces Django's ModelBackend
- ✅ Tenant owners bypass all permission checks
- ✅ Maintains superuser permissions
- ✅ Configured in AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS

### 6. Registration Flow (`apps/users/forms.py`)
- ✅ TermsSignupForm includes `company_name` field
- ✅ Creates tenant on user registration
- ✅ Sets user as tenant owner
- ✅ Links tenant.created_by to user

### 7. Admin Configuration (`apps/tenants/admin.py`)
- ✅ TenantAdmin registered
- ✅ Prevents tenant deletion
- ✅ Shows key fields and filters

### 8. Management Commands
- ✅ `create_test_tenant` - Creates test tenant with owner
- ✅ Useful for development and testing

### 9. App Configuration
- ✅ Tenants app created and registered
- ✅ Added to INSTALLED_APPS
- ✅ Initial migration created

### 10. Tests
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite verifying:
  - Tenant model creation
  - User model fields
  - TenantAwareModel structure
  - Middleware configuration
  - Authentication backend permissions
  - Registration form functionality
  - Management command

## Migration Status
- ✅ Tenant model migration: `0001_initial.py`
- ✅ User model migration: `0007_customuser_is_tenant_owner_customuser_tenant.py`

## Key Design Decisions Implemented
1. **One user, one tenant** - No multi-tenant users
2. **Tenant owners bypass permissions** - Full access within tenant
3. **Company name creates tenant** - During registration
4. **No cross-tenant access** - Complete isolation
5. **Protect on user delete** - Prevents accidental tenant deletion

## Next Steps
Phase 1 is complete. Ready to proceed to:
- **Phase 2**: Update all models to inherit from TenantAwareModel
- **Phase 3**: Update all views with tenant filtering
- **Phase 4**: Update permission system
- **Phase 5**: Update API endpoints

## Testing Phase 1
Run tests with:
```bash
make test ARGS='apps.tenants.tests.TenantPhase1Tests'
```

All 7 tests should pass.
