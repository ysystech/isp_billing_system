## üîÑ Next Steps

1. Run migrations to remove the database table:
   ```bash
   make manage ARGS="makemigrations"
   make manage ARGS="migrate"
   ```

2. If there's existing data, you may need to handle the migration manually or backup first

3. You now have a clean slate to implement your new subscription/payment system

## üìù Notes

- The system no longer tracks any customer payments or subscription periods
- The SubscriptionPlan model still exists as a catalog of available plans
- CustomerInstallation now only tracks the physical installation, not payment status
- All payment/subscription CRUD functionality has been removed
