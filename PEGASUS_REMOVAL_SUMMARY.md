# SaaS Pegasus References Removal Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Footer Component** (`templates/web/components/footer.html`)
- ✅ **REMOVED**: "Built with SaaS Pegasus" link and text from the footer
- This was the main user-visible reference to SaaS Pegasus

### 2. **Settings Comment** (`isp_billing_system/settings.py`)
- ✅ **UPDATED**: Changed comment from "# Pegasus config" to "# Project Configuration"
- This is a code comment, not visible to users

### 3. **Makefile Comment** (`Makefile`)
- ✅ **UPDATED**: Changed "Run after a Pegasus upgrade" to "Run after a system upgrade"
- This is a developer-facing comment, not visible to end users

## References That Were NOT Changed

These references are internal and not displayed to users:

1. **CSS Files** (`assets/styles/`)
   - `pegasus/tailwind.css` - Internal utility classes (pg-button, pg-card, etc.)
   - CSS import statements - Build configuration only

2. **Configuration Files**
   - `pegasus-config.yaml` - Internal configuration file
   - `LICENSE.md` - Legal document mentioning original framework
   - `README.md` - Developer documentation

3. **Requirements Files**
   - Package dependencies - Not user-facing

4. **Variable Names**
   - Internal CSS variables and class names starting with "pg-"
   - These are used for styling but the text "Pegasus" is never shown

## Result

All user-visible references to "SaaS Pegasus" have been removed from the system display. The remaining references are:
- Internal code/configuration that users never see
- Developer documentation
- Legal/license files

The system now displays only your FiberBill branding throughout the user interface.
